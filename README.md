# Classification_Loan-Interest-Rate
Using machine learning models and feature engineering to find pattern and  predict loan interest rate. Compare models and present the results 

This project analyzes a publicly available dataset consisting of 9578 records of data and 14 columns of variables provided by **LendingClub.com** from 2007 to 2012. This project will provide a detailed analysis investigating the relative variablesâ€™ influence on the interest rate to help the business determine which areas to focus on when deciding the interest rate of loans being borrowed to clients.

**Project Summary:**
Project Name: Loan Interest Rate Risk Analysis<br>
Data Source: Kaggle dataset from LendingClub.com<br>
Business Objectives: Identify key variables influencing loan interest rates.<br>
<p>
**Key Achievements:**
Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python.
Employed Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to address imbalanced data.
Implemented various classification models for risk analysis.

**Modeling Insights:**
Logistic Regression Model: Identified "purpose_small_business," "purpose_all_others," and "purpose_major_purchase" as high-interest loan categories.
Decision Tree Model: Emphasized the significance of FICO scores and excluded small business loans as favorable.
Random Forest Model: Highlighted the importance of FICO score, credit policy, and installment payments.
Gradient Boosting Model: Stressed the impact of FICO scores and installment payments on interest rates.
Achieved an impressive accuracy rate of 90.08% with the Gradient Boosting Model.

**Recommendations:**
Loan Approval Criteria: Suggested continuing the use of FICO scores and considering loan purpose as crucial factors in loan approval decisions.
Enhanced Analysis: Advised incorporating additional factors such as geographic location, interest rate type, and loan term for a more comprehensive risk assessment.
